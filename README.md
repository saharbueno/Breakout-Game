## Description
A fun and classic game where you hit a bouncing ball with a paddle at the bottom of the screen. The ball bounces on walls and gets faster when you bounce it from the sides, but gets slower when you bounce it from the middle. The mechanics of this game were implemented using the p5 library of JavaScript and the user interface was designed using simple HTML and CSS.
